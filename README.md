# README Teamplates

## Synopsis
This is a collection of README templates to start off a repo for development or QA.

## Introduction
In order to fascilitate onboarding and other growth activities we want to have a README that provides startup information.
The goals of our README's are:
* To provide context for a repo by stating its purpose directly.
* Help onboarding by providing the minimal set of setup instructions to start working with the repo.
* Provide a cross-road for contact information so people know who to contact with questions.
* Provide links to related projects like codeship
* Make it easier for other developers or QA to know which tests are included and how to run them.

## Usage 
Read through the list of README files provided and select the one closest to your project type.
* Select the readme and use the [raw] view.
* Open the README in your new project.
* Fill in fields you use, delete the ones you don't
