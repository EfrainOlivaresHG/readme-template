# README Teamplates
* [Include badges here, codeship, travis...]
* [Include links to projects on codeship or other online automation if it exists]

## Synopsis
This is a collection of README templates to start off a repo for development or QA.

## Introduction
In order to fascilitate onboarding and other growth activities we want to have a README that provides startup information.
The goals of our README's are:
* To provide context for a repo by stating its purpose directly.
* Help onboarding by providing the minimal set of setup instructions to start working with the repo.
* Provide a cross-road for contact information so people know who to contact with questions.
* Provide links to related projects like codeship
* Make it easier for other developers or QA to know which tests are included and how to run them.

## Motivation
The goal of README templates is fascilitate onboarding new members to the team by reducing startup and tribal knowledge.

## Usage 
### Requirements
* .artifactory

## Tests
You can run the tests at the command line after checking out the Github repo and running the following from the main working directory:
Note that utility libraries will not usually have integration tests.
```
./gradlew integrationTests
./gradlew tests
```
